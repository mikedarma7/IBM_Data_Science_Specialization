# IBM_Data_Science_Specialization

Hello There! 

I am Michael and in this repository I am dumping some of the individual projects I did during my enrollment in the IBM Professional Data Science Specialization course.

In this project, I positioned myself as a franchise investors looking for a business opportunity in Jakarta, Indonesia. Using some of the machine learning tools taught
during the course, I have successfully discovered new insights about business locations in the vicinity of Jakarta, back in March 2020.

Kindly explore the notebook called "Applied Data Capstone Final Project" to grasp the flow of my exploratory and data analytics.

**Disclosure:** I did not upload the rest of the course modules to respect Coursera and the curriculum provider, IBM.
